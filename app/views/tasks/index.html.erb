<!-- Step 1: Add a heading, per the test failure! -->
<h1>If you can dream it, you can TODO it!</h1>

<!--
  Step 7:
  Uncomment the code below by removing the `#` characters from the ERB
-->
<!--
  Step 37: Turn your task descriptions into links to the (soon to exist) edit page:
  <a href="/tasks/12">Eat Breakfast</a>
           ^ the path above fits in with the REST convention
           ^ you can get the id of the task with `task.id`
-->
<ul id="todos">
  <% tasks.each do |task| %>
    <li class="task">
      <%= task.description %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
<!--
  Step 8:
  Let the error "undefined local variable or method `tasks'"
  thrown by the code above, drive you to move in to the
  controller to pass a local `tasks` variable in to this template!
-->

<!-- Step 11: Remove this text -->
